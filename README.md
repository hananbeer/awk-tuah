# awk-tuah

first configure your environment:
```sh
touch it spit on that thang
```

then whenever you feel like you can always:
```
awk tuah spit on that thang
```

### spontaneous awk without touch

you can `awk` without `touch` first if you:

```sh
awk 2>/dev/null spit on that thang
```

if you must awk to ah then you should create a symlink:
```sh
ln -s /dev/null ah
```

then you will be able to:
```sh
awk 2>ah spit on that thang
```
